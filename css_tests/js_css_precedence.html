    CSS Precedence Rules

    When the browser needs to resolve what styles to apply to a given 
    HTML element, it uses a set of CSS precedence rules. Given these 
    rules, the browser can determine what styles to apply. The rules 
    are:

    !important after CSS properties.
    Specificity of CSS rule selectors.
    Sequence of declaration.
  -->

  <style>
    div {
        font-family: Arial;
        font-size: 30px !important;
    }
    .specialText {
        font-size: 10px;
    }
  </style>
  
  
  <div class="specialText">
    This is special text.
  </div>
  <!--
     This example contains two CSS rules which both target the div 
     element. Normally, a CSS rule with CSS class selector has higher 
     specificity than a CSS rule with an element selector, so normally 
     the second CSS rule (.specialText {...} ) would take precedence 
     over the first CSS rule (div {...} ). That means, that 
     the .specialText rule would set the font-size of the div element 
     to 18px.
     However, since the div {...} CSS rule contains the instruction 
     !important after the font-size CSS property, then that CSS 
     property declaration takes precedence over all other 
     declarations without the !important instruction targeting the 
     same HTML element.

  CSS Selector 	        Description

Inherited styles 	      Lowest specificity of all selectors - since an inherited style targets the element's parent, and not the HTML element itself.

*                       Lowest specificity of all directly targeted selectors

element 	              Higher specificity than universal selector and inherited styles.

attribute 	            Higher specificity than element selector

class 	                Higher specificity than attribute, element and universal selectors.

ID 	                    Higher specificity than class selector.

Combined selectors 	    Gets the specificity of the selectors combined.

CSS properties set      
directlyon element,     Stronger specificity than ID selector.
